There are two types of assignments given in this course: daily assignments and graded assignments. The daily assignments are not graded, but one problem from each day is usually included in a graded assignment. Not all lectures have assigned daily problems.

Assignments listed in the table below are from the following textbooks and notes:

(M) Munkres, J. _Analysis on Manifolds_. Cambridge, MA: Perseus Publishing, 1991. ISBN: 0201510359, ISBN: 0201315963 (paperback).

(S) Spivak, M. _Calculus on Manifolds: A Modern Approach to Classical Theorems of Advanced Calculus_. Cambridge, MA: Perseus Publishing, 1965. ISBN: 0805390219.
